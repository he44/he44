### Hi there 👋

#### 🚂 Some toy projects I recently did with ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot:

- [using language models to generate poetry](https://github.com/he44/makemorechinesepoetry).
- [getting started with pybind](https://github.com/he44/pybind_example/).
- [properly controlling worker threads in C++](https://github.com/he44/stop_thread_example).

#### 📝 Notes for some online courses I took:

- [Udemy: The Complete React Native + Hooks Course](https://github.com/he44/React_Native). I didn't finish this one though.
- [Udemy: Modern React with Redux](https://github.com/he44/React-course).
- [Coursera: DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate](https://github.com/he44/TensorFlow-in-Practice-Specialization).

#### 🔯 Dotfiles
